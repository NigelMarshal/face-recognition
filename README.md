**Face Recognition application using React.js and the Clarifai API.**

Upload a photo with a face and the API will detect it using a bounding box. A user can sign in/register to keep track of how many photos they have scanned. I also created a database and server using Node.js, Express.js, bcrypt and PostgressSQL.
